This repository contains code for implementing a novel nowcasting framework that leverages Optimal Transport (OT) theory to enhance short-term forecasting. The methodology includes both a non-parametric approach for imputing missing values using the Sinkhorn divergence and a parametric integration into Dynamic Factor Models (DFM) via an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm.

The files with the PARALLEL suffix employ `parfor` loops to accelerate computational time by parallelizing the tasks across multiple workers. Similarly, the files with the EXPANDING suffix also utilize parallel processing but with the added functionality of expanding windows, enabling more efficient handling of time-varying data by distributing the workload in parallel across dynamic window sizes. Both implementations significantly reduce processing time by leveraging parallel computing.

Functions Overview

These MATLAB functions implement a comprehensive framework for data imputation, dynamic factor modeling, and state estimation.

OT_imputerCONDITIONAL.m
