This repository contains code for implementing a novel nowcasting framework that leverages Optimal Transport (OT) theory to enhance short-term forecasting. The methodology includes both a non-parametric approach for imputing missing values using the Sinkhorn divergence and a parametric integration into Dynamic Factor Models (DFM) via an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm.

RealNonParamNEW.m
A MATLAB implementation of a nowcasting framework using Sinkhorn divergence-based imputation for macroeconomic datasets. The script handles missing data and performs nowcasting across various scenarios, including COVID-19 recession periods.

Core Functions:
- Data preprocessing with standardization and normalization
- Sinkhorn divergence-based imputation with configurable parameters
- Support for alternative methods (KNN, Regression Trees)
- Iterative forecasting simulation
- Results collection and storage

Configuration options include adjustable Sinkhorn algorithm parameters and selective period handling. Outputs are saved in structured .mat files containing nowcasting results and iteration details.

The files with the *PARALLEL* suffix employ `parfor` loops to accelerate computational time by parallelizing the tasks across multiple workers. Similarly, the files with the *EXPANDING* suffix also utilize parallel processing but with the added functionality of expanding windows, enabling more efficient handling of time-varying data by distributing the workload in parallel across dynamic window sizes. Both implementations significantly reduce processing time by leveraging parallel computing.

Remember to use `genpath` to generate the full path of subdirectories and `addpath` to include the necessary directories in your MATLAB environment for accessing all required functions and scripts.
